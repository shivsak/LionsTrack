This should cause users to repeatedly use the app for the fun and competition in comparing your individual data to others in the community.\r\n\r\n<h2>Privacy</h2>\r\nOf course there are great privacy implications anytime that health data is involved.\r\nPrivacy was the central concern throughout our design process.\r\nFor example, we used a keychain to store the users ID so that there is no way to look at the database and associate entries with a user.\r\nIn addition, we only store a random device ID in the keychain, with all health data stored anonymously on the database.\r\nThis makes it impossible to identify a user in anyway.\r\n\r\n<h2>Researcher's Portal</h2>\r\nAs for the researcher’s side, they have a database portal through which they can download the data tables as csv (excel) Files.\r\nAllowing researchers the raw data gives them the most freedom to gain insight into the statistics that they Find interesting.\r\nThat being said we give the researchers information on statistics regarding the database itself such as how frequently people are posting to the database and the types of data they are posting.\r\n\r\n<h2>Screenshots</h2>\r\n<h3>Setting Up</h3>\r\n<img src=\"http://columbia.edu/~ss4757/resources/app-screenshots/lions-track-1.png\" width=\"200px\" />\r\n<img src=\"http://columbia.edu/~ss4757/resources/app-screenshots/lions-track-2.png\" width=\"200px\" />\r\n<img src=\"http://columbia.edu/~ss4757/resources/app-screenshots/lions-track-3.png\" width=\"200px\" />\r\n<br />\r\n<h3>App</h3>\r\n<img src=\"http://columbia.edu/~ss4757/resources/app-screenshots/lions-track-4.png\" width=\"300px\" />\r\n<img src=\"http://columbia.edu/~ss4757/resources/app-screenshots/lions-track-5.png\" width=\"300px\" />\r\n<br />\r\n<h3>Information</h3>\r\n<img src=\"http://columbia.edu/~ss4757/resources/app-screenshots/lions-track-6.png\" width=\"300px\" />\r\n<img src=\"http://columbia.edu/~ss4757/resources/app-screenshots/lions-track-8.png\" width=\"300px\" />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<h2>About Us</h2>\r\n<img src=\"http://columbia.edu/~ss4757/resources/app-screenshots/shiv-circle.png\" width=\"100px\" align=\"left\"/>\r\n<br /> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <b>Shiv Sakhuja</b><br />\r\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Front-End Developer\r\n<br /><br /><br />\r\n<img src=\"http://columbia.edu/~ss4757/resources/app-screenshots/josh-circle.png\" width=\"100px\" align=\"left\"/>\r\n<br /> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <b>Joshua Zweig</b><br />\r\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Back-End Developer\r\n<br /><br /><br />\r\n\r\nThis app was created by Shiv Sakhuja and Joshua Zweig as part of an app design contest by the Columbia Health and Data Science Institute.<br /><br />\r\n\r\n<i>© 2015 Shiv Sakhuja and Joshua Zweig.
